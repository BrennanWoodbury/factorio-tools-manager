# Factorio Multi-Server Manager

Self-hosted web app to run **many Factorio dedicated servers on one home host** behind a
consumer NAT router. Each server is reachable by players at its own subdomain
(`factory1.mydomain.com`) with **no port number to type** and **no reverse proxy** — the
routing is done entirely by DNS **SRV records**.

- Backend: Node.js + TypeScript (Express, `dockerode`, `node:sqlite`, `rcon-client`)
- Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite)
- DNS/DDNS: Cloudflare REST API
- Runs as a single container that manages sibling Factorio containers via the Docker socket.

Already running it? [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) covers which image tag to track, how to roll
back, and what will and won't change under you. Changes are listed in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## How the networking works (read this first)

Factorio's client (v1.1.67+) resolves connections via DNS SRV records. When a player enters
`factory1.mydomain.com`, the client looks up:

```
_factorio._udp.factory1.mydomain.com   SRV   0 0 <gamePort>   host.mydomain.com
```

and connects to `host.mydomain.com:<gamePort>` over UDP. So:

1. **One SRV record per server**, created/updated/removed automatically by this app. Its
   `target` is always the single stable hostname `host.mydomain.com` (SRV targets must be a
   hostname, never an IP or CNAME), and its `port` is that server's unique game port.
2. **One shared A record** `host.mydomain.com` points at your current public IP. Because your
   home IP is dynamic, a background **DDNS job** keeps that one A record in sync. Every server's
   SRV points at it, so a single update follows the WAN IP for all servers at once.
3. **Ports are 1:1, never translated — all the way to the container.** You forward a contiguous
   UDP range **once, by hand** on your router to this host. The app only ever allocates game ports
   from inside that range, advertises exactly that port in the SRV record, publishes it on the same
   host port, and binds Factorio *inside* the container to that same port (via the image's `PORT`
   → `--port`). So `external port == host port == container port == SRV port`, with no rewriting at
   any hop. That end-to-end match is what keeps Factorio's public server listing / NAT
   punch-through pointed at the port players can actually reach.

**RCON** (server admin protocol) is treated completely separately: allocated from its own range,
published only on host loopback (`127.0.0.1`) and reached by the backend over the internal Docker
network. It is **never forwarded and never appears in DNS**.

> Players on Factorio clients older than 1.1.67 don't do SRV lookups and would have to enter
> `host.mydomain.com:<port>` manually. That's an inherent limitation of the SRV approach.

---

## One-time setup

### 1. Forward a UDP port range on your router (manual, once)

In your router's NAT / port-forwarding settings, forward a **contiguous UDP range** to this
host's LAN IP, using the **same** external and internal ports:

| Setting        | Value                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Protocol       | **UDP**                                           |
| External ports | `34197-34297` (or whatever you set `GAME_PORT_RANGE` to) |
| Internal IP    | your host's LAN IP (e.g. `192.168.1.50`)         |
| Internal ports | `34197-34297` (same range — do **not** remap)    |

Do **not** forward the RCON range. The app never allocates a game port outside this range, so any
server it creates is guaranteed reachable.

### 2. Cloudflare DNS (optional — configured in the dashboard, not env)

Skip this to run without DNS (players connect by `IP:port`). To enable automatic SRV + DDNS,
open the dashboard → **DNS / Cloudflare settings** and enter your base domain, host record, Zone
ID and API token (with a **Test connection** button). It saves to the app's database and takes
effect immediately — no restart, nothing in `.env`. To get the values:

1. Your domain's DNS must be managed by Cloudflare.
2. Create an API token at **Cloudflare → My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token → Custom token**
   with **Permissions:** `Zone` → `DNS` → `Edit`, **Zone Resources:** `Include` → `Specific zone`
   → *your domain*.
3. Find your **Zone ID** on the domain's Cloudflare overview page.

The app creates DNS-only (unproxied) records — it never enables the orange-cloud proxy, which
can't carry Factorio's UDP protocol.

### 3. Configure and launch

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env — at minimum set ADMIN_PASSWORD (that's the only required var)
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open `http://<host>:8080` and log in with `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

### 4. Or on Unraid

The published image is a **single container** — API and web UI in one — so it installs
like any other Unraid app. A template lives at
[`templates/factorio-tools-manager.xml`](templates/factorio-tools-manager.xml).

Until it's listed in Community Applications, install it by hand: **Docker → Add Container →
Template → paste the raw template URL**, or drop the XML into
`/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/` and pick it from the template dropdown.

Only two things need setting: **Admin Password**, and the **Game Port Range** if you didn't
use the default — it has to match the UDP range you forwarded in step 1. Everything else has
a working default.

Two things make this work without any manual wiring on Unraid, and are worth knowing about
because they're what a plain `bridge` install would otherwise get wrong:

- **The manager attaches itself to `factorio-net` at startup.** It has to be on that network
  to reach each server's RCON, but the network doesn't exist until the manager first runs, so
  it can't be selected at install time. Getting this wrong fails *quietly* — servers run and
  play fine while the console and player list report `ENOTFOUND`.
- **The host path behind the data mount is detected from the manager's own mount table.** The
  Factorio containers are siblings on the host daemon, so their bind mounts have to be host
  paths. That means the appdata mount can be an ordinary `/mnt/user/appdata/… → /data`, with no
  identity mount and no `HOST_SERVERS_DIR` to keep in sync.

The Factorio servers it creates appear in Unraid's Docker tab without templates of their own —
that's expected; manage them from this app. They also survive a manager update, and are left
running if you remove the manager (`STOP_SERVERS_ON_SHUTDOWN` changes that).

> **Data location.** Persistent data (SQLite DB + per-server saves/mods/config) is stored at
> `/opt/factorio-tools-manager`. Override with `FTM_DATA_DIR` (e.g.
> `FTM_DATA_DIR=$HOME/.factorio-tools-manager`).
>
> The compose file bind-mounts it at the *same* path inside and outside the container. That's
> tidy but no longer required: the manager reads its own mount table at startup to learn the
> host path behind its data dir, so any mapping works and `HOST_SERVERS_DIR` only exists as an
> override. That matters because the Factorio containers are siblings on the host daemon — their
> bind mounts must be expressed in host paths, and guessing wrong yields a server that starts
> with none of its saves.

## Using it

- **Create a server (wizard):** a multi-step flow that starts from one of three sources —
  **generate a new map**, **import a map exchange string**, or **load an existing save**. Progress is
  kept server-side as a **draft**: a real server row in `lifecycle='draft'` with its ports already
  reserved, so a half-finished server can never collide with a real one and never shows up on the
  dashboard. Drafts are listed under "Continue new server", survive a restart, and are pruned
  automatically after they expire. Only **finalize** promotes the row to `lifecycle='active'`,
  allocating the subdomain and creating the SRV record.
- **Test & Create:** before finalizing, the wizard can boot the server once in a throwaway
  container and stream the result live (SSE). It reports the actual failure — bad mod, unloadable
  map-gen settings, wrong game version — instead of leaving you to read a crash loop afterwards.
  Anything it creates is discarded; only the generated map is kept.
- **Load from save:** upload a `.zip` and the manager reads the save's own header (`level-init.dat`)
  directly — no container boot — to report the exact **Factorio version**, scenario and **full mod
  list with pinned versions**, shown as chips the moment the upload finishes. Bundled expansion mods
  are enabled from that list; mod-portal mods are downloaded **at the versions the world was built
  with**. If a required mod can't be fetched, creation fails loudly — which matters because Factorio
  itself does *not* error on a save with missing mods, it silently drops them and hosts a gutted
  world.
- **Container logs:** a live viewer for the container's stdout/stderr (separate from the RCON
  console), streamed over SSE with scrollback, follow-tail, error/warning highlighting, download,
  and automatic re-attach when the server restarts. Works on a stopped server too — you still see
  the last container's output.
- **Factorio.com account:** one global account (username + token), set on the Servers dashboard,
  used by **every** server for mod-portal downloads and the public server listing. There are no
  per-server credentials.
- **Settings page:** manager-wide configuration lives on a single **Settings** tab, split into
  "Shared across instances" (Factorio.com account, server defaults, global whitelist/adminlist,
  global advanced server settings) and "Manager config" (DNS / Cloudflare). The active subsection is
  mirrored to the URL hash (`#settings/<key>`) so it can be linked directly.
- **Server defaults (cascade):** the **Defaults** section sets global defaults for auto-restart and backup
  config. These **cascade**: saving pushes the new value to every server that hasn't overridden it;
  a server that overrode a setting keeps its own value until you click **"Reset to global default"**
  on that field. New servers start out inheriting everything. Also sets a default **modpack** and
  **map template** applied to new servers at creation (changeable in the wizard).
- **Lifecycle:** start / stop / restart / delete. Delete removes the container, DNS record,
  releases the ports and deletes the data dir.
- **Console:** live RCON console + player list (over loopback / Docker network only).
- **Saves:** upload a `.zip`, list, create a new named save on demand (offline, via a one-shot
  container), pick which to load next, **restore** (load a save now — selects it and (re)starts),
  download, delete.
- **Backups:** on-demand ("manual") snapshots (kept under the server's `backups/` dir) plus
  **scheduled automatic backups** per server (toggle + interval, default every 15 min). Manual and
  auto backups have **separate keep-newest-N retention** — one never evicts the other, and a manual
  backup doesn't reset the auto schedule. Backing up a running server forces a fresh save via RCON
  first. Each backup can be downloaded, restored ("Restore from here" — into a save; server stopped),
  or deleted from the UI.
- **Map generation:** the in-game map-generation sliders — resource frequency/size/richness (iron,
  copper, coal, stone, uranium, oil), water, trees, enemy bases, cliffs, starting-area size,
  peaceful mode and map seed — available **in the create-server wizard** and on a per-server **Map
  gen** tab. Written to `config/map-gen-settings.json` only when you customize it, and applied to the
  **next new map generated** (first start with no save, or a new save from the Saves tab); doesn't
  alter an existing world. `map-settings.json` (pollution/evolution/expansion) is left to the image's
  version-matched example — Factorio validates it strictly against the exact binary version, so a
  hand-written one isn't safe.
- **Game modes:** each server is **Vanilla**, **Space Age**, **Space Age — without Quality**, or
  **Modded** (chosen in the create wizard, editable on the Map gen tab). The mode drives which
  map-gen sliders show — Vanilla is Nauvis-only; the Space Age modes show curated **per-planet**
  resource sliders (Nauvis, Vulcanus, Gleba, Fulgora, Aquilo) — and sets which bundled expansion
  mods are enabled on next start. For **Modded** servers, a **Detect resources from mods** button
  runs the mod set once (`get_map_exchange_string` → parsed to JSON) to populate **dynamic sliders**
  for that modpack's actual resource controls.
- **Bundled mods are read from the image, not hardcoded:** which expansion mods a mode enables is
  derived from the **dependency graph in the image's own `info.json` files**, read once per image
  and cached. This is not incidental — it's the difference between working across Factorio releases
  and breaking on each one:

  | | `space-age` requires |
  | --- | --- |
  | **2.0.x** | `base`, `elevated-rails`, **`quality`** (hard) |
  | **2.1.x** | `base`, `elevated-rails`, **`recycler`**, and `+ quality` (optional) |

  So on 2.1 the new `recycler` mod is enabled automatically — nothing in this repo names it — while
  on 2.0 the manager knows "Space Age without Quality" is impossible (`quality` comes back through
  the closure) and **refuses it with an explanation** at start / Test & Create, rather than letting
  the container die on `Missing required dependency quality >= 2.0.0`. The wizard greys the mode out
  when the selected Factorio version can't run it. A future release that splits out another mod
  needs no code change here.
- **Map preview:** on the Map gen tab (and in the wizard), a **Preview map** button renders a PNG of
  your current (unsaved) settings via a throwaway Factorio one-shot (`--generate-map-preview`, using
  the server's mods) — click the thumbnail to expand it full-res, or reroll the seed. On Space Age
  modes you get a preview **per planet**, each rendered with that planet's own surface settings.

  > The modded map-gen paths (dynamic sliders, modded previews) are marked **Experimental** in the
  > UI: they depend on each modpack exposing sane map-gen controls, and are not guaranteed to work
  > with every mod set.
- **Map exchange strings:** paste a `>>>…<<<` string from Factorio's in-game map generator to
  **import** it — decoded to JSON by Factorio's own parser in a one-shot (needs the same version +
  mods), which populates the sliders and attaches version-correct map settings — or **export** the
  current settings as a shareable string on demand. An **Advanced** section edits the raw
  map-gen-settings JSON directly.
- **Map templates:** save a map-gen configuration as a named, reusable **template** (e.g. "all ores
  at 300%") and pick it when creating a server. A template is just a JSON manifest + DB record — no
  server link — that's **exportable/importable** for sharing. Managed under the **Templates** tab;
  a couple ("Rich resources", "Peaceful") are seeded by default. "Save as template" is available
  from any map-gen editor.
- **Server settings:** edit the full `server-settings.json` (visibility, game password, autosave,
  `allow_commands`, AFK kick, pause rules, non-blocking saving, …) via a structured form plus a
  raw-JSON escape hatch. Each field **inherits the global default** (set on the **Defaults** tab)
  until you change it; a changed field shows a **reset-to-global** button, and only the overridden
  fields are stored — so untouched fields keep tracking the global default.
- **Auto-restart on change:** an optional per-server toggle — when on, saving a change that only
  takes effect at start (version/tag, server settings, mods, whitelist) automatically restarts the
  server in the background if it's running (only when a value actually changed); otherwise changes
  apply on the next manual start.
- **Whitelist & admin list:** per-server *and* **global** player whitelists and admin lists. Each
  effective list (global ∪ per-server) is written to `server-whitelist.json` / `server-adminlist.json`
  on start; an empty whitelist leaves the server open. Applies on next start/restart.
- **Per-server Factorio version:** each server picks its version from a dropdown — **stable**,
  **latest (experimental)**, or **custom** (any image tag, e.g. `2.0.55`) — overriding just the tag
  of the configured base repo (`FACTORIO_IMAGE`). The image is **pulled on every start/restart** to
  pick up updates to moving tags; if the registry is unreachable it falls back to the local copy.
- **Mods:** search the Factorio Mod Portal by keyword and add mods with one click; upload a mod
  `.zip` manually; enable/disable; update all to latest; delete all; export a shareable manifest.
  With the global Factorio.com account set, enabled mods are downloaded on save. Changes apply on
  next start.
- **Modpacks (shared registry):** build named, reusable mod collections once and **apply them to
  any server** (packs are manifests only — no binaries or credentials; mods are downloaded with the
  global Factorio.com account). Create a pack from scratch, snapshot one from a server, or
  **import/export** a pack as a JSON manifest to share it. Editing a pack doesn't auto-change
  servers; re-apply is explicit ("re-apply to all N servers using this pack"). A built-in
  **"Space Age"** modpack (`space-age` / `quality` / `elevated-rails`) is seeded on first run;
  those official expansion mods ship with the game data (they need the Space Age DLC) and are
  never downloaded from the portal — the manager just enables them in `mod-list.json`.

### Mods: why the Mod Portal API (not `UPDATE_MODS_ON_START`)

The manager downloads mods directly via the [Factorio Mod Portal API] instead of relying on the
image's `UPDATE_MODS_ON_START`. This lets it **validate a mod name and surface download failures
in the UI before the container starts**, rather than discovering a bad mod from a crash loop in
container logs, and gives deterministic control over versions. Tradeoff: more code, and we handle
mod-portal auth ourselves. Automatic dependency resolution is out of MVP scope — enabling a mod
downloads that mod's latest release only.

## Local development

### Option 1 — Dev stack in containers (hot reload)

The easiest path — nothing to install on the host:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up   # run from the repo root
```

Both services run from bind-mounted source with live reload (backend via `tsx watch`,
frontend via Vite HMR). The first `up` runs `npm install` into named volumes (slow once,
fast after). The backend drives the host Docker daemon and joins `factorio-net`, so RCON
works over the Docker network — same wiring as production. Open **http://localhost:5173**
(default login `dev`). Run it from the repo root so the data dir resolves correctly.

### Option 2 — On the host (no containers)

```bash
# Backend (API on :8080). RCON_MODE=loopback so it reaches the published RCON ports.
# NB: the backend reads env vars directly — it does NOT load .env; pass them inline.
cd backend
npm install
ADMIN_PASSWORD=dev RCON_MODE=loopback DATA_DIR=$PWD/data npm run dev

# Frontend (Vite dev server on :5173, proxies /api → :8080)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> ⚠️ **Host mode breaks once a Factorio container has written to the data dir.** The Factorio image
> runs as `PUID`/`PGID` `845` and chowns the files it creates (config, saves, mods) to that uid. A
> backend running on the host as *you* then gets `EACCES` on those paths. This only affects Option 2
> — in the dev stack and in production the backend runs as root inside a container. Either use
> Option 1, or `sudo chown -R $USER` the data dir between runs.

Typecheck, test and build:

```bash
cd backend  && npm run typecheck && npm test   # node:test
cd frontend && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build   # vitest + jsdom
```

Frontend tests run components for real under jsdom — which has no `EventSource`, so the log
viewer's tests stub it and drive `ended` / `error` by hand. That makes reconnect behaviour
(including its backoff) deterministic and assertable without a network or a container.

### Releases

Releases are tag-driven, so merging to `main` never reaches users: `main` publishes only
`edge`, and `latest` — which the Unraid template tracks — moves solely on a version tag.

```bash
# edit CHANGELOG.md under [Unreleased], then:
node scripts/release.mjs 1.2.3      # bumps versions, promotes the changelog,
                                    # updates the template, commits and tags
git push --follow-tags origin main
```

The tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which re-checks that the tree agrees
with the tag, runs the tests, publishes `1.2.3` / `1.2` / `1` / `latest` (stamping
`APP_VERSION` into the image), and opens a GitHub Release from the changelog section.

See [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) for the tag policy, rollback procedure, and what counts
as a breaking change.

### Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the backend (typecheck + `node:test`), the frontend (typecheck +
vitest + Vite build) and `scripts/validate-template.mjs` on every push and PR. The template check
is not optional politeness: Community Applications serves `templates/*.xml` and `ca_profile.xml`
straight from `main`'s raw URLs, so a malformed template is live the moment it merges. On pushes it additionally builds and publishes the Docker image,
tagged `latest` and `sha-<short>`.

The publish job is **opt-in and self-disabling**: it is skipped unless the repository variable
`DOCKERHUB_IMAGE` is set (e.g. `youruser/factorio-tools-manager`), so a fork with no registry
configured still gets green checks. To enable it, set that variable plus the secrets
`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`.

**SQLite tables:** `servers` (identity/config, including the `lifecycle` draft/active column and
`draft_state_json`), `port_allocations` (atomic port registry, PK `(kind, port)` makes
double-allocation impossible), `dns_records` (Cloudflare record bookkeeping for reconcile/cleanup),
`modpacks` / `modpack_mods`, `map_gen_templates`, `kv` (singletons like last public IP / host
A-record id). Schema changes ship as numbered migrations applied on boot.

### Draft lifecycle

Every server row carries a `lifecycle` of `draft` or `active`. A wizard run creates the row up
front as a `draft` — with real ports reserved and a placeholder subdomain (`__draft_<id>`) — and
stores wizard progress in `draft_state_json`. The repository's `list()` filters on
`lifecycle='active'`, which is the single choke-point keeping drafts off the dashboard and out of
DNS. Finalizing flips the row to `active` and assigns the real subdomain; abandoning it (or the
prune job) deletes the row and releases its ports.

## Error handling

Realistic failure modes return structured JSON errors (`{ error: { code, message } }`):

- **Port pool exhausted** → `409 PORT_POOL_EXHAUSTED`
- **Duplicate subdomain** → `409 DUPLICATE_SUBDOMAIN`
- **Cloudflare API failure** → `502 CLOUDFLARE_ERROR` (server creation is rolled back so no ports
  are left claimed for an unreachable server)
- **Docker daemon unreachable** → `502 DOCKER_ERROR`
- **Container fails to start / bad mod** → surfaced live by **Test & Create** in the wizard, and via
  the container **logs** endpoint / live log stream afterwards; mod download errors are reported
  per-mod when applying a mod list
- **Game mode impossible on the chosen Factorio version** → `400 VALIDATION` naming the conflict,
  raised before any container starts (see bundled mods above)
- **Save needs a mod we can't fetch** → creation fails with the mod named, *before* any container
  starts. This is deliberate: Factorio does not error on a save whose mods are missing — it drops
  them and hosts the world anyway — so the check has to happen from the save header, not the log
- **Validation** (bad subdomain label, save name, etc.) → `400 VALIDATION`

## Security notes

- The UI can start/stop/delete infrastructure — it's gated by a single admin login. Put it behind
  TLS (reverse proxy) and set `FORCE_SECURE_COOKIE=true` for production.
- RCON is never exposed off-host.
- The Docker socket is mounted into the manager (root-equivalent on the host) — treat access to
  the UI accordingly.
